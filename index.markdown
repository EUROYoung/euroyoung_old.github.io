EUROYoung is a Forum of [EURO](https://www.euro-online.org/), the European Association of Operational Research Societies.
We provide training, dissemination, and networking opportunities to young Operational Researchers.

The objectives of EUROYoung include:

* Fostering **collaboration** among students and early-career researchers in O.R.;
* Providing young O.R. scholars and practitioners with tools to advance their careers, mainly through **training**;
* Creating **networks** both among young researchers and with more senior leaders in the field of O.R.;
* Connecting demand and offer in the **O.R. job market**, both in academia and the industry.

# Workshops

The EUROYoung workshops are the main events organised by our Forum.
With these workshops we want:

* To **create a bond** between researchers going through a delicate phase of their career and preparing themselves to be the faculty and practitioners of tomorrow;
* To promote **peer-education** and give young researchers the opportunity to teach their colleagues something unique they have learnt;
* To share knowledge from established O.R. &ldquo;**seniors**&rdquo; to the new generations.
* To provide **affordable** (approaching zero-cost) opportunities to young researchers to present their work, learn, and network.
* To promote **[EURO](https://www.euro-online.org/)**, its activities, instruments, and resources.

## Next workshop

* To be announced, it will take place in 2023.
