## Call for abstracts

To maintain an atmosphere of conviviality, foster fruitful discussion and keep the quality of the event high, **all sessions at the workshop are plenary**.
For this reason, not all participants might have time to five a full-length talk (15 minutes + 5 minutes for questions).
The organisers will inform the participant about abstract acceptance briefly after the abstract submission deadline.

The submissions must be sent via email to [workshop@euroyoung.eu](mailto:workshop@euroyoung.eu) between April, 10 and April, 30.
